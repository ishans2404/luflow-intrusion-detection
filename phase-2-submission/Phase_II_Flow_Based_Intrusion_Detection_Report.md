**Name:** Ishan Singh  
**Reg No.:** 22BCE2608

---

## Introduction

This document presents the comprehensive data engineering pipeline and machine learning model benchmarking for a flow-based network intrusion detection system built on the LUFlow dataset. The work demonstrates end-to-end data processing capabilities, handling 7,890,694 network flows with robust preprocessing, quality assurance, and multi-model evaluation targeting resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

The implemented pipeline achieves production-grade performance with Random Forest delivering 94.97% accuracy at 0.0114ms per sample inference latency, making it suitable for edge-class hardware deployment. The comprehensive evaluation framework includes accuracy metrics, feature importance analysis, memory profiling, and temporal distribution validation across 135 daily CSV files spanning June 2020 to June 2022.

## Data Acquisition and Source Analysis

### Dataset Overview

The LUFlow Network Intrusion Detection Dataset serves as the primary data source for this investigation. LUFlow represents a continuous, flow-based network telemetry collection system deployed within Lancaster University's network infrastructure, capturing both production traffic and honeypot-generated attack vectors.

#### Source Characteristics

**Data Collection Methodology:** LUFlow employs Cisco's Joy tool for flow-level telemetry capture, generating 16 engineered features per network flow. The system operates continuously, producing daily CSV files organized in YYYY/MM folder structures for temporal management.

**Ground Truth Generation:** The dataset implements an autonomous labeling mechanism through correlation with third-party Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sources. This approach enables real-time classification of network flows into three distinct categories: benign, malicious, and outlier traffic patterns.

**Temporal Coverage:** The investigation utilized 241 available daily CSV files discovered through recursive directory traversal, spanning from June 2020 through June 2022. This temporal range ensures exposure to evolving attack vectors and seasonal traffic patterns.

### File Discovery and Inventory Process

The data acquisition phase implemented a systematic file discovery mechanism to catalog all available CSV files within the input directory structure. The process identified 241 individual daily files, providing comprehensive coverage of network telemetry across multiple months.

**Monthly Distribution Analysis:**
- 2020.06: 12 files
- 2020.07: 31 files  
- 2020.08: 31 files
- 2020.09: 30 files
- 2020.10: 30 files
- 2020.11: 30 files
- 2020.12: 28 files
- 2021.01: 29 files
- 2021.02: 17 files
- 2022.06: 3 files

This distribution reveals varying data availability across months, necessitating balanced selection strategies to prevent temporal bias in the final dataset.

## Data Engineering Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Design Overview

The data engineering pipeline implements a multi-stage architecture designed for scalability, reproducibility, and quality assurance. The pipeline processes large-scale network telemetry while maintaining strict quality controls and balanced sampling across temporal partitions.

<img src="assets\data-pipeline-flowchart.png" alt="LUFlow Data Engineering Pipeline Architecture - Complete workflow from raw CSV files through model training and evaluation" width="50%">

### Temporal File Selection Strategy

To ensure balanced representation across the available time periods, the pipeline implements an enhanced file selection algorithm that addresses temporal skew while maximizing dataset size.

**Selection Algorithm Parameters:**
- Target dataset size: 8,000,000 flows
- Maximum files per month: 15
- Minimum files per month: 8
- Final file selection: 135 files

**Balanced Selection Results:**
The algorithm produced the following monthly file allocations:
- 2020.06: 12 files (all available)
- 2020.07-2021.02: 15 files each (capped selection)
- 2022.06: 3 files (all available)

This strategy ensures no single month dominates the dataset while maintaining sufficient temporal coverage for robust model generalization.

## Data Preprocessing and Quality Assurance

### Schema Standardization

The preprocessing pipeline implements comprehensive schema validation and feature mapping to ensure consistency with the Joy tool's output format. The standardized schema includes 15 predictive features plus target labels.

**Feature Mapping Table:**

| Joy Feature | Dataset Column | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| src_ip | src_ip | uint32 | Source IP address (anonymized) |
| src_port | src_port | float32 | Source port number |
| dest_ip | dest_ip | uint32 | Destination IP address (anonymized) |
| dest_port | dest_port | float32 | Destination port number |
| protocol | proto | uint8 | Protocol identifier (TCP=6) |
| bytes_in | bytes_in | uint32 | Bytes transmitted source→destination |
| bytes_out | bytes_out | uint32 | Bytes transmitted destination→source |
| num_pkts_in | num_pkts_in | uint16 | Packet count source→destination |
| num_pkts_out | num_pkts_out | uint16 | Packet count destination→source |
| entropy | entropy | float32 | Data entropy (bits per byte) |
| total_entropy | total_entropy | float32 | Total flow entropy |
| mean_ipt | avg_ipt | float32 | Mean inter-packet arrival time |
| time_start | time_start | float32 | Flow start timestamp |
| time_end | time_end | float32 | Flow end timestamp |
| duration | duration | float32 | Flow duration |
| label | label | category | Target classification |

### Memory Optimization Strategy

Given the large-scale nature of the dataset (7.89M records), the pipeline implements aggressive memory optimization techniques to enable processing on standard hardware configurations.

**Data Type Optimization:**
- Automatic downcast of integer types (int64 → uint32/uint16)
- Float precision reduction (float64 → float32)
- Categorical encoding for string labels
- Explicit dtype specification during CSV loading

**Memory Management:**
- Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- Aggressive garbage collection after each batch
- Intermediate result cleanup
- Memory usage monitoring and reporting

### Stratified Sampling Implementation

The pipeline implements stratified sampling at multiple levels to preserve class distributions while managing computational constraints.

**Per-File Stratified Sampling:**
Each daily CSV file undergoes stratified sampling to extract approximately 59,259 flows while preserving the original class proportions. This approach prevents individual high-volume days from dominating the final dataset.

**Sampling Algorithm:**
```python
def stratified_sample_robust(df, n_samples, label_col='label', random_state=331):
    class_counts = df[label_col].value_counts()
    class_props = class_counts / len(df)

    sampled_dfs = []
    for cls, prop in class_props.items():
        cls_df = df[df[label_col] == cls]
        cls_target = max(int(n_samples * prop), 1)

        if len(cls_df) >= cls_target:
            cls_sampled = cls_df.sample(n=cls_target, random_state=random_state)
        else:
            cls_sampled = cls_df

        sampled_dfs.append(cls_sampled)

    return pd.concat(sampled_dfs, ignore_index=True)
```
